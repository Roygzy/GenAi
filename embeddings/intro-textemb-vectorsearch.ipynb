        "In this tutorial we will use `textembedding-gecko@001` model for getting text embeddings. Please take a look at [Supported models](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/embeddings/get-text-embeddings#supported_models) on the doc to see the list of supported models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once you get the model, you can call its [get_embeddings](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/aiplatform/latest/vertexai.language_models.TextEmbeddingModel#vertexai_language_models_TextEmbeddingModel_get_embeddings) function to get embeddings. You can pass up to 5 texts at once in a call. But there is a caveat. By default, the text embeddings API has a \"request per minute\" quota set to 60 for new Cloud projects and 600 for projects with usage history (see [Quotas and limits](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/quotas#request_quotas) to check the latest quota value for `base_model:textembedding-gecko`). So, rather than using the function directly, you may want to define a wrapper like below to limit under 10 calls per second, and pass 5 texts each time."

        "\n",
        "For example, if an user asks a question, Embeddings API can convert it to an embedding, and issue an query on Vector Search to find similar embeddings in its index. Those embeddings represent the actual business data in the databases. As we are just retrieving the business data and not generating any artificial texts, there is no risk of having hallucinations in the result.\n",

        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we have used the Stack Overflow dataset. There is a reason why we had to use it; As the dataset has many pairs of **questions and answers**, so you can just find quesions similar to your question to find answers to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "In many business use cases, the semantics (meaning) of questions and answers are different. Also, there could be cases where you would want to add variety of recommended or personalized items to the results, like product search on e-commerce sites.\n",
        "\n",
        "In these cases, the simple semantics search don't work well. It's more like a recommendation system problem where you may want to train a model (e.g. Two-Tower model) to learn the relationship between the question embedding space and answer embedding space. Also, many production systems adds reranking phase after the semantic search to achieve higher search quality. Please see [Scaling deep retrieval with TensorFlow Recommenders and Vertex AI Matching Engine](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/scaling-deep-retrieval-tensorflow-two-towers-architecture) to learn more.\n",

        "### Hybrid of semantic + keyword search\n",
        "\n",
        "Another typical challenge you will face in production system is to support keyword search combined with the semantic search. For example, for e-commerce product search, you may want to let users find product by entering its product name or model number. As LLM doesn't memorize those product names or model numbers, semantic search can't handle those \"usual\" search functionalities.\n",

        "[Vertex AI Search](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/vertex-ai-search-and-conversation-is-now-generally-available) is another product you may consider for those requirements.
